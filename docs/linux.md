* List the users using `less /etc/passwd`. The first column is the username.

* i3wm is a good tiling manager. It is very customizable and has a lot of features. It is also very lightweight. 

* I use vim for light text editing and VSCode for more complex tasks. I also use vim for editing files on the server.
